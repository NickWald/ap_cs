## These are the test files and programs from my AP CS class

Most of these files are just for me, and I'm using github to ensure all my work is saved in a repository for both working on multiple computers, and so that I can always keep a backup copy of my schoolwork.

### Getting Around
These folders contain these files:
	
**/in_class**
This contains all the testing, notes, and stupid programs I make in class.

**/LABS**
This contains any labs I am working on for class.

**/simple_programs**
Some simple fundamental programs made Summer 2019

**/summer_testing**
pure fuckery.
