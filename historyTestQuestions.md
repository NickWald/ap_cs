# Identify and describe four causes of the Spanish-American War.

## 0. BACKGROUND
* Tensions originated from the struggling Cuban cause for independence, which began in 1895
  * United States had always held a strong interest in the island of Cuba
    * US sympathized with the Cubans during their ultimately unsuccessful rebellion against Spanish colonial rule (late 1860s to late 1870s)
  * After Cuba successfully abolished slavery, US made large investments in sugarcane production in Cuba
## 1. CUBAN RESISTANCE
* Exiled Cuban journalist and poet Jose Marti organized and deployed a guerrilla resistance to Spanish rule in Cuba
  * His resistance destroyed American sugar mills and plantations
  * did this in hopes of getting the American's attention and possibly support in establishing democracy and defeating the Spanish.
* In 1896 Spain sent General Weyler to Cuba in order to put down the resistance
Weyler herded ~300,000 Cubans from rural ares into concentration camps where many died from starvation and disease
## 2 - YELLOW JOURNALISM
* Spanish intervention in Cuba fueled a rivalry between American newspapers (New York Journal, New York World)
  * Papers published exaggerated accounts from inside the Cuban resistance and imprisonment, invoking American sympathy with the struggling Cuban people
  * After sending artists to capture the true Cuban rebellion, these newspapers learned that war between the US and Spain was far from a likely future
* Demands for intervention in the Cuban resistance mounted after the inauguration of President William McKinley
  * McKinley preferred avoiding war with the Spanish, and attempted to resolve the issue through diplomacy - at first this succeeded - until 1898
* In February 1898, NY Journal published a stolen private letter written by the Spanish Minister to the US
  * Letter was leaked to press by a Cuban rebel
    * In the letter, the minister criticized the American president, calling him weak, resulting in the minister’s resignation, and the ignition of widespread anti-Spanish sentiment throughout the US
